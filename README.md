---------------------------------------------------
What did you want to do but were unable to because you ran out of time?
- Create the backend using Node, Express and Mongo. Would have to setup the server and seed a lot of data!

If you were given another 2 days what would you change?
- Change the way I fetched the locations, perhaps a tweak in the backend to make the query faster/make a projection for the necessary info
- Repetitiveness in the code
- Style object into CSS style sheet
- Take a closer look at the different Google API's

How would you have approached the problem differently if you were to do it again?
- Add more functionality in the backend
